# 📝 Student Assignment Grader using MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Welcome to the **Student Assignment Grader**, a project built using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This system is designed to **automatically grade student assignments** by leveraging a structured and modular approach based on MCP.

- **Context**: Handles data input, formatting, and interpretation
- **Protocol**: Governs the flow and structure of processing and output
